TLDR: Follow the steps outlined below to build metal. For more in-depth information, keep reading

Steps:
    1. Create python_env (you only need to do this ONCE): ./create_venv.sh
        - The env will by default be created in $TT_METAL_HOME/python_env. If you want to change it, set the PYTHON_ENV_DIR.
        - This step is not dependent on any of the other steps; you only need to run it ONCE and in any order.
    2. Configure and generate build files: `cmake -B build -G Ninja`
        - The `-B` indicates where the build folder is; you can change the folder name to whatever you want.
        - The `-G Ninja` specifies to cmake to use the Ninja build system, which is faster and more reliable than make.
    3. Build metal: `ninja install -C build`
        - The general command would be: `cmake --build build --target install`
        - The `-C` indicates where to run the command; in this case, it will be your build folder(s).
        - We are targeting `install` since that will also just build src.
        - The install target will install pybinding .so (_C.so & _ttnn.so) into the src files, so pybinds can be used.
    4. Build cpp tests: `ninja tests -C build`
        - Building tests will also automatically build src.

Notes:
    - YOU ONLY NEED TO BUILD THE PYTHON_ENV ONCE!!!!! (unless you touch the dev python dependencies)
    - ALWAYS INSTALL, i.e., just run `ninja install -C build` as the new make build.
    - `cmake --build build --target install` is the EXACT same as running `ninja install -C build`. You would use the cmake command if you want to be agnostic of the build system (Ninja or Make).

Different configs: To change build type or use tracy, you have to change the configuration cmake step (step #2).
    - Changing build types: `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<type> -G Ninja`
        - Valid CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE values: `Release`, `Debug`, `RelWithDebInfo`, `CI`
        - Release is the default if you do not set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
    - Tracy: `cmake -B build -G Ninja -DENABLE_TRACY=ON`

Now you can have multiple build folders with different configs. If you want to switch, just run `ninja install -C <your_build_folder>` to install different pybinds.
    - Caveats:
        - At least one of these folders has to be named `build`, and if using tracy config, it has to be named `build`.. pending issue #8767.
        - They have to be built with the original build folder name, i.e., you cannot change the build folder name after building because it will mess up the RPATHs and linking.

Example:
    ./create_venv.sh
    cmake -B build -G Ninja && ninja -C build                       # <- Build in Release, inside folder called `build`.
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B build_debug -G Ninja && ninja -C build_debug    # <- Build in Debug, inside folder called `build_debug`.
    source python_env/bin/activate                                  # <- You cannot run pytests yet since pybinds have not been installed.
    ninja install -C build                                          # <- Install Release pybinds.
    <run a pytest>                                                  # <- This test ran in Release config.
    ninja install -C build_debug                                    # <- Install Debug pybinds.
    <run a pytest>                                                  # <- This test ran in Debug config.

NOTE ON DEBUGGING!:
    GDB/LLDB is not stable right now. Recommend using GCC11 or higher for debugging or Clang-17 with GDB 14+.
